# 2021-25projects
End of the year I try to be more wiz and done 25 coding projects.

## Projects (updated after project is done)

* Shithead card-game

# three rules for myself

* Projects had to be more than 100 lines of code.
* Project ideas can be shitty but after I mark them done they had to work.
* Not only in one language!


> If I fail I had to do make something crazy.
