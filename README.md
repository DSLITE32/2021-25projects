# 2021-25projects
End of the year I try to be more wiz and done 25 coding projects.

## Projects (updated after project is done)

* Network packet sniffer - Sniffs usernames, passwords, unwanted traffic in the network. Also can block traffic.
* Runmeworm - Tries to replicate himself for bruting SSH ports in network. Could work better with some exploit but it's just sample.


# three rules for myself

* Projects had to be more than 100 lines of code.
* Project ideas can be shitty but after I mark them done they had to work.
* Not only in one language!
